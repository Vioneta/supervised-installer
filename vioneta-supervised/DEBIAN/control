Description: Vioneta Supervised This installation method provides the full Vioneta Agro experience on a regular operating system. This means, all components from the Vioneta Agro method are used, except for the Vioneta Agro Operating System. This system will run the Vioneta Agro Supervisor. The Supervisor is not just an application, it is a full appliance that manages the whole system. It will clean up, repair or reset settings to default if they no longer match expected values.
